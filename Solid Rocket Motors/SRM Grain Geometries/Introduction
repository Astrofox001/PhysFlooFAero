This part of the PhysFloof Aero directory concerns details surrounding propellant geometries.
While it may be possible for these geometries to be applied to hybrid motor grains, the initial focus is on solid rocket motor design.

So what is important about grain geometries?
Well, grain geometries allow for different thrust profiles throughout a motor's burn. This can help to reduce loads on a vehicle, among other things.

The geometries I focus my attention on don't necessarily need to be useful.
If anything, the process of determining a grain geometry's behavior is mentally engaging and a fun challenge.
Participation in this madness is recommended, and serves to also expand one's mathematics toolset or problem solving techniques.
I hope that some of these will be investigated by individuals in the EX motors community and see if their results match my predictions.
