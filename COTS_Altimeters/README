The information in this folder is relevant to Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) altimeters.
Here, models of altimeters can be found as well as drilling guides/one-piece standoffs.
Each model was produced in TinkerCAD to the best of my ability, and has worked reasonably well in practice.
The USB port on the EasyMini v2.0 model is a little big, but it's an easy fix by anyone with an EasyMini, or it can simply be taken as-is for those not concerned about volume constraints.
